RISWIS

Retrieval Integrity & Structured Weighted Information System

Phase 1 — Deterministic Ranking Skeleton

Phase 1 establishes the structural foundation for RISWIS:

Config-driven tier multipliers

Deterministic scoring (seed-controlled)

Top-K enforcement

Reproducible audit logging

Who / Why / Seed trace metadata

Runnable sample manifest

Similarity scores are currently simulated to validate ranking logic and audit structure independently of embedding variability.

This phase focuses on:

Separation of configuration and logic

Reproducibility

Structured trust and traceability

Layered system development

Future phases will integrate embedding-based similarity while preserving deterministic audit discipline.
